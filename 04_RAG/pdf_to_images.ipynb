When the syrup comes to a boil, put in enough peaches to fill your jar, whatever the size. Boil until tender enough to pierce with a wisp. Take the fruit out carefully with a spoon and place in the jar. Fill the jar with the boiling syrup, being careful always to leave the space you jar as you pour it in. If you do this, the jar will never crack, as it is likely to do if held perfectly straight or upright. Always run around the inside of the jar with a silver knife, and you will have no trouble in keeping fruit. Seal while hot. The peaches may be canned whole, if preferred.\n",

When the clams have cooled a little, pick them from the shells, remove the night-caps, cut off the head, to the shoulders, washing each clam. Cut three or four slices of fat salt pork and fry in the bottom of a kettle, with half an onion. Skim these from the fat, pour in the clam liquor, add a little hot water. When this boils, add the raw potatoes, which have been pared and sliced thin, and cook until tender. Split the crackers open and soak till soft is milk or water. Add these and the clams to the potatoes. Cook ten minutes, then add a quart of milk and salt, if needed. Do not let it boil after adding the milk. Serve hot. This is very delicious.\"\n",

       "* 1/2 teaspoonful of salt\n",
       "* 1/4 teaspoonful of sugar\n",
       "* 1/2 teaspoonful of active dry yeast (or 1/2 yeast cake)\n",
       "* 1 cupful of warm water (or milk)\n",
       "\n",
       "Instructions:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, salt, sugar) together in a bowl.\n",
       "2. Add the yeast to the warm water (or milk) and let it dissolve.\n",
       "3. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.\n",
       "4. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n",
       "5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size.\n",
       "6. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n",
       "7. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf.\n",
       "8. Place the loaf in a greased loaf pan and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Alternative Methods:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* From the \"Nut Bread\" recipe, you can add chopped nuts to the dough for added flavor and texture.\n",
       "* From the \"Oatmeal Bread\" recipe, you can use rolled oats and boiling water to create a unique bread.\n",
       "* From the \"White Bread\" recipe, you can use a simpler method that involves rubbing sugar, salt, and lard into the flour, then adding yeast and water.\n",
       "* From the \"Brown Bread (Baked)\" recipe, you can use a mixture of Indian meal, molasses, and rye meal to create a denser, darker bread.\n",
